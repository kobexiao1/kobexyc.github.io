	<h2>From G7.3 Kobe xiao</h2>
	<p>I will put the story here</p>
	<p>Rauru, the wise sage of the Light Temple, had received a troubling vision: Ganondorf, the evil king of the Gerudo tribe, was planning to invade Hyrule Castle and take Princess Zelda captive. Rauru knew he had to act fast, so he sought out the young princess herself.Zelda listened carefully as Rauru told her about his vision. She knew she couldn't just sit back and let Ganondorf take over Hyrule. Together, she and Rauru came up with a plan. Zelda would flee the castle disguised as a commoner, while Rauru would gather the other sages to help defend Hyrule.The two set off on their separate paths, but not before Rauru gave Zelda a special medallion that would allow her to communicate with him if she got into trouble.Zelda made her way through the woods, keeping a low profile so as not to draw attention to herself. But as she neared Kakariko Village, she was ambushed by a group of Ganondorf's soldiers. She fought bravely, but soon found herself outnumbered and outmatched.That's when she remembered the medallion Rauru had given her. She held it tightly and called out for help. Within moments, Rauru appeared beside her, flanked by the other sages. Together, they drove off the soldiers and escorted Zelda safely to a secret hideout in the mountains.From there, Rauru and the sages launched a counterattack against Ganondorf and his army, using their magical powers to keep the invaders at bay. Meanwhile, Zelda donned her royal garments once more and rallied the people of Hyrule to her cause, inspiring them to fight for their freedom.In the end, Rauru and Zelda's bravery and quick thinking paid off. Ganondorf was defeated, his armies routed, and Hyrule was safe once more. Rauru and Zelda shared a quiet moment of celebration, knowing that they had saved their kingdom from certain doom. </p>
